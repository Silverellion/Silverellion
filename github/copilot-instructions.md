- Always provide the complete content of the file when implementing new code or making changes to it.
- Avoid inserting filler or placeholder comments such as // Your existing code, // Continue here, or similar.
- Avoid adding any debug output statements (e.g., `console.log()`, `printf()`, `cout <<`) for checking or testing purposes.
- Never remove or alter my original comments, regardless of the edits being made.
- Do not change the formatting or spacing of existing comments. For example, if a comment has 3 spaces before or inside it, preserve those exact spaces. Keep the comment style, indentation, and alignment exactly as-is.
- When adding or modifying code, insert a comment before and after the code block to mark the changes. For example:

```cpp
// Start of changes
for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++) {
    cout << "Hello!";
}
// End of changes
```
